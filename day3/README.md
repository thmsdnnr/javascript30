##CSS Variable Manipulation in JS
====
Simple variable manipulation script to change the attributes set in :root css when the sliders are triggered. Enhancement would be to use something less resource-heavy than `inputs.forEach(input=>addEventListener('mousemove', slideRule));` to trigger variable value updating when the slider is being held and dragged.
