        <p>Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Use your imagination, let it go. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends.</p>
        <p>Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is.</p>
        <p>The least little bit can do so much. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him.</p>
        <p>You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. Let's get wild today. What the devil.</p>
        <p>Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk.</p>
        <p>I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. That's crazy. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing.</p>
        <p>I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen.</p>
