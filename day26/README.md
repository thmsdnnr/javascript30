#Day Twentysix of JS30
##Stripe inspired Navbar
====

###Stuff I always forget:

* `d.style.transform=`translate(${e.clientX}px,${e.clientY}px)`;` the PX ON THE TRANSLATE!@

* flex-flow: row wrap;

* Something's wrong with the kill-hover but we're getting there.

###TODO:

* .invisible and .navchild are now flexboxes!

* Make .invisible a container using flexbox and the children use flex
* More programmatic div assemblage and insert into div.invisible as child
* Prettier "divot" at top of navbar
* Slightly more responsive?

* Right now there's a child div in the hidden div. maybe a better way of doign this.
