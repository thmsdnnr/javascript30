# Javascript30
my 30 vanilla JS in 30 days challenge code [https://javascript30.com/](https://javascript30.com/)

Javascript30 is a sweet project hosted by Wes Bos. Build 30 projects in Vanilla Javascript in 30 days with 30 tutorials. With:
**"NO FRAMEWORKS, NO COMPILERS, NO LIBRARIES, NO BOILERPLATE"**.

I'm looking forward to beefing up my JS knowledge, particularly without relying on jQuery or other popular frameworks, as well as quickly iterating through projects, pushing a committed project out every day.

I'm doing this along with my FreeCodeCamp projects on my quest to become a Front-End Developer. Huzzah!
