#Day Sixteen of JS30
##CSS Text Shadow MouseMove Effect
====

##Goals:

* Go back and re-code the mouse handling code to get a better handle on how this all works intuitively!

* When the mouse moves over the text, tweak the box shadow to follow the mouse movement

* Learning about offsetX and offsetY but nested elements required extra math. Had to rely pretty heavily on the tutorial to get this working: I could grab the mouse position easily but figuring out the content offset height/width, the e.target!==this and etc. was from the tutorial, not me :(. Oh well, it's about learning! I have a better idea of how to handle the x position and y position on the screen now and offsets, and I can apply that in my HTML5 canvas project updates, for instance, or some gameplay &c.
