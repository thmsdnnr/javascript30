#Day Twentyone of JS30
##Geolocation
====

# FINDINGS:

This works okay, although the speed can be kinda quirky and the "distance" calculation, which tries to compare timestamps and average speed over the interval, doesn't seem to work at all yet, and there aren't any bugs in the code I can see. I think this might be a limitation of the website over creating a mobile app. It would be fun to learn React Native and see if I could create a more accurate app. Anyhow, it's easy enough to geolocate, and the most common uses are probably not for a mobile device, unless you're using the LAT/LON.
