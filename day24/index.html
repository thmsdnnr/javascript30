      <p>I want the true and beautiful and I want it now. I want the grecian urn, I want the golden cow. I want the wise and wonderful, the things that make distinct. I want the whole anemone the sea that's painted pink. I want my aspiration's quenched my thirst for mind fulfilled. I want to crest the mountain and every dollop and hill.</p>
